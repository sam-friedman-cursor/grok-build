"""Global guardrail registration for tools and LLMs.

Guardrails can either sanitize data recorded on lifecycle events or reject a
call before it runs.

In managed ``tools.execute()`` and ``llm.execute()`` flows, sanitize
guardrails are observability-only: they change the payload written to emitted
events, not the value passed to the user callback or returned to the caller.

Example::

    import nemo_relay

    def redact(tool_name, args):
        return {**args, "api_key": "***"}

    nemo_relay.guardrails.register_tool_sanitize_request("redact", 10, redact)
